-----
This repository holds the configuration files that I use for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].

I am using a partial literate configuration. At the moment the main configuration file is tangled from a single org-document, but there are other files that are pure emacs-lisp rather than literate org-mode files.

This particular Doom configuration is for my main Linux distro that at the moment is the Manjaro Sway Community Edition.
-----

** Main Files
1) ~config.org~
   - An org-mode file written in org markup that has blocks of emacs-lisp code embedded within it
   - This is the main configuration file that when tangled exports out to the ~config.el~ file

2) ~config.el~
   - This is the emacs-lisp configuration file that is created from ~config.org~
   - This is the file that you would normally edit directly to configure Doom Emacs

3) ~init.el~
   - This file comes pre-configured specific to Doom Emacs
   - Generally speaking this is where you can toggle different Doom packages on and off

4) ~packages.el~
   - The file where I can control the installation of other packages that are not included in Doom Emacs
   - You can also pin Doom packages to specific versions

5) ~abbrev.el~
   - This is basically a huge list of commonly misspelled English words
   - It is used by the ~abbrev~ package to automatically correct my mistakes
   - I added some things that I commonly type out so abbrev will autoexpand them
   - For example:
     ~pkg~ + ~space~ will autoexpand to ~(package!~ just because I found that to be convenient

6) ~bindings.el~
   - I decided to create a separate file for my personal custom keybinds

7) ~custom.el~
   - Doom Emacs is set up to create this file in your configuration directory
   - It's only created if the user makes any changes via the ~customize~ interface
   - In my case I used ~custom-set-faces~ instead of ~setq~ in my config a couple of times

8) Other resources such as images are put in the ~misc~ subfolder.

*** The end result

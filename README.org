* Doom Emacs Configuration

This repository holds the configuration files that I use for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].

I am using a partial literate configuration. At the moment the main configuration file is tangled from a single org-document, but there are other files that are pure emacs-lisp rather than literate org-mode files.

I'm using this Doom configuration for my main Linux distro which is Manjaro Sway right now.

** Main Files
+ ~config.org~
  - An org-mode file written in org markup that has blocks of emacs-lisp code embedded within it
  - This is the main configuration file that when tangled exports out to the ~config.el~ file
  - The ~config.el~ file is not in this repo. It has no information not found in ~config.org~

+ ~init.el~
  - This file comes pre-configured specific to Doom Emacs
  - Generally speaking this is where you can toggle different Doom packages on and off

+ ~packages.el~
  - The file where I can control the installation of other packages that are not included in Doom Emacs
  - You can also pin Doom packages to specific versions

+ ~abbrev.el~
  - This is basically a huge list of commonly misspelled English words
  - It is used by the ~abbrev~ package to automatically correct my mistakes
  - I added some things that I commonly type out so abbrev will autoexpand them
  - For example:
    ~pkg~ + ~space~ will autoexpand to ~(package!~ just because I found that to be convenient

+ ~bindings.el~
  - I decided to create a separate file for my personal custom keybinds

+ ~custom.el~
  - Doom Emacs is set up to create this file in your configuration directory
  - It's only created if the user makes any changes via the ~customize~ interface
  - In my case I used ~custom-set-faces~ instead of ~setq~ in my config a couple of times

+ Other resources such as images are put in the ~misc~ subfolder
